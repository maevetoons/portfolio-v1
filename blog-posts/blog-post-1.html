            I moved to Brooklyn 6 years ago from a small town in Pennsylvania and ever since, I have fallen in love with the
            city.
            One aspect of manmade construction that I recently realized and deeply connect with is the abundance of history,
            character, and passion present in every building or bridge. Everything we build has a purpose behind it and
            understanding this purpose not only connects us with mankind's history but also with the environment and the natural
            world. Whether I'm walking through the colorful graffiti streets of Williamsburg or the along the Brooklyn Bridge, I
            am
            imbued with cultural history all around me. The world is a vast place with countless buildings and markers of
            mankind's
            presence, yet it would take a lifetime to even truly know a place like New York City. Each structure implements
            knowledge of construction that we have gathered over millennia, each acting as a testament to the collective
            progress of
            mankind and our journey to understanding our relationship with nature and ultimately, our place in the universe.
            I study civil engineering because I want to learn more about our relationship with nature and how we not only
            transform
            it, but embrace it and coexist with it. I am interested in the inner workings of a city: how the wastewater is
            transported and sanitized, how greenery and nature is incorporated in an effective way, how past engineers designed
            the
            streets and sidewalks and how it determined what transportation would facilitate the movement of the people. I want
            to
            be part of that human journey, to serve the people and create art in the form of construction.
