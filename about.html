            <div class="intro">
                I am a fullstack software engineer and embedded systems engineer studying Electrical Engineering and CS at MIT. I'm
                strongly
                interested in software, hardware, and AI/automation. I am also curious about design, environmental sustainability,
                and
                linguistics.

                <!-- My relationship with identity is a crucial piece of me that has been present since my teenage years. I came out as
                        trans during quarantine, and the journey of coming to terms with my own identity as well as dealing with the backlash of family
                        members has been one of great adversity. Coming from a traditional Chinese background and a low-income family, I
                        found
                        it hard to connect with the experiences of other trans people. This conflict with identity, not only regarding
                        gender
                        but race and socioeconomic status, was not without support. Living in NYC, society is overall very progressive and
                        inclusive, and by surrounding myself with like-minded peers at school, I was able to build a support network. Even
                        though my struggles with identity are an ongoing battle, I'm slowly starting to figure out who I am and
                        understanding my
                        place in the world. -->
